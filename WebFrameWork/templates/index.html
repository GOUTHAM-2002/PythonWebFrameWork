            Hey, welcome to my Python web server! ðŸš€ Let me show you around my code â€“ it's like giving you a backstage pass to the magic behind the scenes. First up, I've defined app.py which is the starting file of this application just like how Flask works.I have used wsgi interface to host it on a simple server,But Goutham aren't you building this entire framework on your own and shouldn't you also naturally build your web server gateway interface for your python framework? Yes, I tried that and realised im no Philp J(creator of wsgi) and it would take months to study server network architecture to code it, my goal was to create a simple python web framework and i promptly achieved that.(For all you dumb dumbs who don't know what wsgi is , it's like a gateway which lets your python web framework be hosted on a server).
            I have created a class called api and overloaded the __call__ method which makes my object of class api be called as a function since wsgi needs a function and not a class. I have used decorator functions similar to flask so that once a specific url path is received by the server the request is forwarded to that particular function.
            I have also added an option to parse a particular url to fetch the name and display it. Following networking standards I have ensure no new duplicates routes to be created by a particular user via throwing an assertion error. The mos impressive part of this web framework is that you can create any html page and save it inside the templates directory and render it easily just like you do in Django and flask, this allows you to host simple static websites and this a very minimalistic web framework is achieved.
            That sums up my project. Peace Out!.
