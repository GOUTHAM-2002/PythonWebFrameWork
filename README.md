# PythonWebFrameWork💻
This is a simple web framework I created which functions similar to flask and django.
This framework has a templates directoery which can render any static html pages.
I plan on delving deeper into devoloping my own architecutres to understand how web frameworks function .😀

To test the application just clone the repo and install the required modules and run app.py file.
